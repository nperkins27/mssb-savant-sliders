# Vendored VERBATIM from ProjectRio-web app/season_metrics.py
# (https://github.com/ProjectRio/ProjectRio-web/pull/154), so this site computes exactly what Rio's season_metric
# table holds. Do not edit it here: change it upstream, then copy it back.
# NOTE: includes gen_runs_per_9, gen_runs_against_per_9, pitch_special_catches_per_9
# and bat_two_strike_whiff_pct, and removes bro(b) from cCHARGE_TIMING_CHARS
# (cPOWER_CHARS unchanged). None of that is pushed to the PR yet.
'''Computation of per-season advanced percentiles (the "Savant Sliders" set).

Split deliberately into two halves:

  * Pure functions -- percentile ranking, the higher/lower inversion, and the
    adjusted ELO formula. No database, no Flask. These hold all the logic that
    is easy to get subtly wrong, so they can be unit tested directly.
  * Database functions -- one aggregate pass per season, then a bulk upsert.

The aggregate is ONE statement on purpose. The production database caps
max_connections at 25 and managed-platform agents hold a large share of that,
so this must open one connection, do one scan, and close. Running a statement
per metric is what took the database down during design.

Metric definitions, floors and the reasoning behind them are documented in
savant_sliders_s7_validation.sql.

    their own extra floor, so far fewer players clear them. A percentile is not
